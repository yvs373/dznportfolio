      <b>This page displays the mandatory policies a client needs to agree prior to hiring/working with zMagnus.</b><br>
      <br>
      (1)➔ Failing to comply/ reading these before a conflict will be treated as a fault on the client/buyer's <br>
      end and will have consequences.<br>
      <br>
      (2)➔ A minimum 33.34% of the total price will be taken as advance on the initiation of an design order.<br>
      No advance = Order will not begin.<br>
      <br>
      (3)➔ No. of revisions is limited:<br>
      Default : 3 revisions<br>
      for +1 revision : +2$<br>
      <br>
      (4)➔ No Refunds, under any circumstances.<br>
      <br>
      (5)➔ If you want to buy something else which are not in the list kindly message us and the prices will be decided according to
      the complexity & situations regarding your request. <br>
      <br>
      (6)➔ All the designs pre-payment will unconditionally be watermarked.<br>
      <br>
      (7)➔ If the client is found to be not following any of the rules, order may be terminated without any prior notice and even banned<br>
      or blacklisted based on the severity of offence.<br>
      <br>
      (8)➔ Not following any of the aforementioned rules and regulations can lead to order termination and ban, without the need to<br>
      announce the reason, therefore its heavily emphasized on reading all guidelines and rules before ordering to prevent <br>
      potential conflicts. <br>
      <br>
      (9)➔ While ordering FX be absolutely polite towards the designer. Any kind of rudeness towards designer will not be taken<br>
      lightly. If the comments are racist, sexist or other ill-minded snide remarks, the said person will be blacklisted. <br>
      Do not take the politeness from any of us for granted, we uphold the quote: Give respect, Take respect.<br>
      <br>
      (10)➔ Be patient when you order something from zMagnus. When you order something make sure you are ready to wait <br>
      and maintain a patient attitude, as making a graphic/visual design requires time and skill, rushing the designer will simply <br>
      result in the quality being downgraded and stressing out the designer.<br>
      <br>
      (11)➔ Plagiarizing, stealing, scamming, not paying and other offences will lead to banning and blacklist as well as immediate <br>
      order termination. <br>
      <br>
      (12)➔ Not reading guidelines and committing offences in unawareness will be completely the offender's fault.<br>
      <br>
      (13)➔ Baseless criticism will be considered false defamation and you will be blacklisted. Stealing our designs, scamming us <br>
      or other unethical activities will lead to blacklist as well.<br>
      <br>
      (14)➔ Clients willing to pay in Indian Rupees via Gpay will have different (reduced) prices due to “INR PAYMENT DISCOUNT”,Mention the same while ordering, to redeem this discount.<br>
      Discounts:<br>
      <br>
      (15)➔ Returning Customers ( Customers who order after ordering 3 times before, therefore the fourth order from the same client) are eligible for <br>
      “ RETURNING CLIENT DISCOUNT”.RETURNING CUSTOMER DISCOUNT: 2% off the grand total in applicable currency<br>
      <br>
      (16)➔ If a customer is eligible for both the aforementioned discounts that is, 14 (INR PAYMENT DISCOUNT) and 15 <br>
      (RETURNING CUSTOMER DISCOUNT), the discount will be compounded as follows (explained using an example): <br>
      Lets assume the grand total for the said order is 100 US$, the person decides to pay in INR and so by conversion<br>
      as per July 2023 will be 8170 INR (approximately). Firstly, they will be eligible for discount 14 and so:  <br>
      8170*0.02 =163.4       <br>
      8170-163 = 8007 INR       <br>
      Secondly, lets say this the 4th order from the same client, they are eligible for discount 15 as well:      <br>
      8007*0.02 = 160.14<br>
      8007-160 = 7847 INR              <br>
      Therefore, the final price for this assumed order will be INR 7847. ( please note that this order is also eligible for bulk<br>
      discount, as it is above the bulk discount minimum threshold i.e. $70) ( if applied, it will be compounded after discount 15)<br>
      <br>
      (17)➔ Compounding of discounts will follow the following order:<br>
      INR PAYMENT DISCOUNT (d14) > RETURNING CUSTOMER DISCOUNT (d15) > BULK DISCOUNT<br>
      <br>
      (18)➔ Bulk Discounts are only applicable to a certain order once the grand total of the order crosses the bulk discount <br>
      minimum threshold i.e. $90 (subject to change at any given point).       <br>
      BULK DISCOUNT: 4% off the grand total in applicable currency<br>
